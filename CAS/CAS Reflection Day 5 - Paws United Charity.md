# CAS Reflection Day 5 - Paws United Charity
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

After walking into Repulse Bay from Ocean Park, I went to PUC Centre to volunteer in the night shift. There are three shifts for PUC: an AM shift from 10 to 2, a PM shift from 2 to 7, and a Night shift from 7 to 10. As the opening time for visitors for PUC is 11 to 6, the night shift is when us volunteers don't have to face the public and can spend our three hours with the cute puppies.

> We checking on one of the puppies Daron for any blood marks

As they were having their dinner, one of the larger puppies Cory picked on a small puppy named Daron. After 5 minutes, we found out that we have blood stains on our shoes, thus found out that Daron has been bitten by her ear. We had to use 'blue solution' and cotton balls to help her to sanitize the wound.
It was not my first time facing puppies that fight and injured, thus I knew where the blue solution and cotton balls are at.

After this tiring day of endless fight-stopping, I've learnt to prepare myself by getting myself familiar of the process of first aid for puppy. I've also learnt to keep an eye on puppy fight and to spray water to stop fight as soon as their playing went too far.

# CAS Reflection Day 1
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

 For the first day of CAS Week, I've decided to start on a game programming project with my peer Wholesome. We have been planning on which topic to do, and we have ended up with horror.
 The first issue that came up was the choice of game engine. There are many engines out there such as Unity, Unreal Engine and Gamemaker. We had to choose a versatile but easy to approach engine. We have chosen Unity as our game engine as it provides both 2D and 3D and there are a lot of tutorials on Unity in Youtube.
 We learnt how to create basic game by following [this tutorial in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZpJzpE2lQ). I was frustrated as I have never used C# language before, and I only understand fundamental Python and JavaScript.
 Thankfully the transition to C# wasn't too difficult thanks to the documentation provided by [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) and [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/).
 After 3 hours of following through the tutorial, I successfully made an unfinished game in which a sprite can jump around the space and collect coins. Although this tutorial was easy and basic, it taught me the most basic stuff for Unity, such as how to link materials to objects and how to add physics to a game.
 After the tutorial, we planned for the gameplay of the game and started assets to the project file.
 I will improve myself by watching more tutorial on Youtube and read the documentation on C# to make the next programming session more smooth.

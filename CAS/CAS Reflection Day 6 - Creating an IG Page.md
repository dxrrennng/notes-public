# CAS Reflection Day 6 - Creating an IG Page
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

Wholesome and I wanted to create an IG page to promote appreciation to your homeplace and we were thinking of good ideas of the Instagram handle but most of our ideas were cringey or cannot stand out. We finally ended up with [@hoeng1_gong2](https://www.instagram.com/hoeng1_gong2/), which is the Cantonese Jyutping for 香港.
With this unique handle, we also had to think of a hashtag to fit our purpose of creating the page, which is \#takepicofyourhomeplace.

> our Instagram profile

We filtered around a hundred of photos and ended up with five pictures that we think can show the pretty side of Hong Kong.
We used software online to slice the picture into six sections such that it can be shown in a banner style, which is eye-catching.

We tried to promote the page by sharing it on our personal Instagram accounts.

After today's Instagram page creation, I learnt how to manage Instagram page and how to fine-tune images before publishing to social media.
I hope that I can apply the knowledge learnt today to my own IG account.

Although I knew the basics of snooker, my accuracy for collision that does not form straight line is bad. During the snooker game, I gradually gained confidence on hitting the cue ball with different forces and in different angles.
I taught some of them who don't know how to play snooker with the rules as they were prone to pool. We all had fun during the process.
After the snooker session, we switched to playing basketball. As there is only half court for us to play, we had to split into 4 teams and play 3v3 basketball.
We learnt different strategy as the game goes on, and it teaches the importance of teamwork, as one person carrying the ball during the whole time and shoots often don't have good results.
After this tiring day, I started to know more about my peers as I rarely talk to some of them due to lack of same class.

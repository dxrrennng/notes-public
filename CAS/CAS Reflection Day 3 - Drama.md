# CAS Reflection Day 3 - Drama
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

For day 3, I have decided to help out drama team in the morning with Wholesome Wong to create choreography for shooting on the 13th Dec.
Although being a member of drama team, I haven't tried acting a lot as my role is technical support, so this task helps me understand the job of being an actor.
The lack of props for the shooting on the 13th Dec means that we have to act out as backdrops also. We experimented with different positions on acting as lamps, tables and caves.

I, Wholesome and Ryan Liu acted as the Dad, Mom and Son for a family. Due to lack of props, we had to act out different actions without the prop, such as using a computer without having an actual computer.
Today's task taught me how to carefully allocate resources such that the shooting can run smoothly on 13th Dec while still looking professional.
I also learnt how to work as a team as we had to constantly negotiate between different poses and positions but we all agreed on a solution at last.

# CAS Reflection Day 7 - Bowling and cycling
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

For the last day of the CAS Week, Avi, Adrien, Wholesome, Geoffrey and Felix and I went to Festival City in Tai Wai to bowling. We had to stretch before bowling as there is a large risk of getting wrist injury if we overturn our hands when we release the bowling ball.

We decided to not add borders for everyone to increase the difficulty. At first, we all landed gutter balls, but we started to pick up the pace as we select the correct sized ball.
We landed a few spares and even strikes, which was very exciting for us as we were all beginners.

In the afternoon, we parted ways with Felix, Wholesome and Geoffrey as they had other stuff to do. 
After lunch, Avi, Adrien and I went to rent bikes in Shatin for 50 dollars per bikes which we can ride till 7 pm. We had no idea nor did we plan for our destination, so we just followed the bicycle track.
The scenery was amazing as we ride our bikes across New Territories.
After 45 minutes of nonstop riding, we took a rest by the road and took a few photos, I also found a sign directing us to Tai Mei Tuk so we decided to go to there.
There were a few upslopes where I had to get off my bike and walk my bike up the slope.
At last we went to Tai Mei Tuk at around 4 and I am thankful that I didn't get hurt during the 3 hours of cycling.

After today's tiring schedule, I went back home to do some cool down stretching and took a long nap. I've learnt to cycle safely on cycling tracks and also how to prevent sports injury in general. This skill can be utilized during my PE lessons and rope skipping trainings and I believe that I will cycle more in the near future as it is fun and challenging at the same time.

> Me and Jason Lam marking primary kids' exercise on arithmetic sequence

For day 2 of CAS Week, I've decided to help my tutorial centre by assisting my tutor for the whole day. I have been studying in this tutorial centre in Mong Kok since grade 7 and my maths ranking have risen from fifties in G7 to 8 in G9.
We started working after lunch by creating marking schemes for past papers for G7 final. I understood how difficult the process is as we have to provide reasoning for all MC choices. We also had to provide a range of accepted answers, and it involved a lot of trial and error.
As the class for primary is held, we stopped working on the marking scheme and started to help the kids on the exercises. We had to communicate with them while using simple-to-understand phrases such that their process of learning isn't challenging.
I also had to refresh my memory on arithmetic sequencing, as me and Jason both forgot how to work out the general term of sequence. Thankfully we digested the concept quickly and started to teach the kids in an orderly manner.
As the class ended, I continued working on the answer keys until dusk.

After today's fruitful experience, I learnt how to communicate with younger kids and understood the hardship of being a tutor. My respect for teachers in general has grown after the experience as a full day of teaching is very tiring mentally and physically.

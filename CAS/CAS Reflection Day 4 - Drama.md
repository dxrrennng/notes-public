For day 4 of the CAS Week, I and Wholesome went to film the drama act which we planned on day 3.

We had to film the act during the lunchtime and despite the short amount of time given to film the act, we filmed most of the act with high quality.

As I have been using this camera in the media team for a long time, I have gained a lot of knowledge of the camera, such as how to access every menu item with the shortest period of time.

After today's filming session, I've learnt the importance of planning and preparation work, as it can save a lot of time on the filming day.
Also, I am learning how to become a better director as I have to audio cue the actors their in and out positions.

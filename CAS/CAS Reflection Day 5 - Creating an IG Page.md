# CAS Reflection Day 5 - Creating an IG Page
### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

I have always chosen minibuses or buses as the mean of transport from Ocean Park Station to PUC Centre due to the lack of time, but I've decided to try walking on day 5 of my CAS Week.
I, Wholesome and Steven met together in Mong Kok East Station and got ourselves to Ocean Park Station via MTR.
As we arrived to Ocean Park Station, I proposed the idea of taking pictures of our journey and posting it to Instagram. We all agreed that this could raise the awareness of appreciating our homeplaces.
Steven and I took out our sport cameras borrowed from the school and started to film our process of walking into Repulse Bay via the promenade.

We took pictures in Deep Water Bay and Repulse Bay as we continued to walk on the promenade. The sun was setting which gave our picture a purple tint which makes the picture looks a lot more mood-y and beautiful.
We started to talk about how people who live in these areas have no stress and can walk their dogs, sunbathe at the beach, live in their mansions while people in the city have to work 8 hours a day as they struggle to live in small flats. The huge contrast is devastating, as we can see how unequal the distribution of wealth is.

After today, we learnt to treasure what we have, and also that Hong Kong have many hidden gems where we can take a deep breath and relax. I would definitely recommend my schoolmates to try walking this route and to appreciatehow beautiful nature can be.

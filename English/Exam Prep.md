|             | Poem                                       | Advert                                     |

| Affordances | have different forms                       | have different forms, no language barriers |
| Limitations | languauge barriers, lack of visual appeals | cannot describe as much as poem can        |

I prefer adverts than poem as adverts can grab attention and I prefer visual appeals than texts.

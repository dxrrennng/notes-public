## Types of lenses

- Converging lens = convex
- Diverging lens = concave

## Principal focus

- For converging lenses
	- when a beam of light parallel to the principal axis passes through a converging lens it is refracted so as to converge to a point on the axis called the principal focus, F
	- F is a real focus
- For diverging lens
	- diverging lens has a virtual principal focus behind the lens, from which the refracted beam seems to diverge

- Since light can fall on both faces of a lens it has two principal foci, one on each side, equidistant from C, the optical center
- The distance CF is the focal length $f$ of the lens
	- more curved the lens faces are, the smaller is $f$ and the more powerful is the lens

## Ray diagrams

1. A ray parallel to the principal axis which is refracted through the principal, F
2. A ray through the optical centre, C, which is undeviated for a thin lens
3. A ray through the principal focus, F, which is refracted parallel to the principal axis

## Magnification

The linear magnification, $m$ is given by
$$m = \frac{\text{height of image}}{\text{height of object}}$$
$$m = \frac{\text{distance of image frome lens}}{\text{distance of object from lens}}$$

## Power

- the shorter the focal length of a lens, the stronger it is (the more it converges or diverges a beam of light)
- the focal length is measured in meters $$P = \frac{1}{f}$$

# Total Internal Reflection

#physics

## Critical angle

$n = \frac{1}{\sin c}$

## Criteria for Total Internal Reflection

```ad-note
title: Total Internal Reflection
When light is incident on a boundary of lesser optical density at an angle of incidence greater than a critical angle, $c$, all of the light is reflected inside the denser medium.
ie, $i>c$
```

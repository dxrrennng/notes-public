## Facts about refraction

- Light bends towards the normal when it enters an optically denser medium, $r<i$
- Light bends away from the normal when it enters an optically less dense medium, $r>i$
- Ray emerging from a parallel-sided block is parallel to the ray entering but displaced sideways
- Ray travelling along the normal does not refract

## Refractive index

$n=\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$

## Refraction by a prism

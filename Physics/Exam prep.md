#physics 
## Energy
work = force x distance moved in direction of force
> unit = $$J = N \times m$$

power = work done / time taken
> $$P = \frac{E}{t}$$

Conservation of energy
- energy cannot be created or destroyed

## KE and PE
kinetic energy
> $$ E_k = \frac{mv^2}{2}$$

potential energy
> $$ \Delta E_p = mgh$$

loss of pe = gain of ke
> $$ \frac{mv^2}{2} = mgh$$

## Pressure
pressure = force / area
> unit = $$ Pa = \frac{N}{m^2}$$

hydralic machines
> $$ F = f \times \frac{A}{a}$$

liquid pressure
> $$ P = \rho g h$$

## Molecules
- Brownian motion
	- random motion due to collisions with fast moving air molecules

- Kinetic theory of matter
	- used to explain the existaence of the solid, liquid and gaseous states

1. solids
	- particles are close together
	- molecule vibrates to and fro about a fixed position
	- rigid arrangement such as crystalline and lattice
	- incompressible
2. liquids
	- particles are slightly further apart than solids
	- slipping past each other in all directions when vibrating
	- arranged according to container shape
	- incompressible
3. gases
	- particles are much further apart than liquids
	- freely move in all directions
	- arranged according to container shape or atmosphere
	- compressible

## Gas laws
charles' law
> $$V \propto T$$
> $$ \frac{V}{T} = constant$$

pressure law
> $$p \propto T$$
> $$ \frac{p}{T} = constant$$

boyle's law
> $$pV = constant$$

combined gas laws
> $$ \frac{pV}{T} = constant$$

## Expansion
- thermostat
	- uses a bimetallic strip
	- change in curvature due to different amount of expansivity of metal

## Specific heat capacity
heat equation
> $$ Q = m \times c \times \Delta T$$

## Latent heat
heat equation
> $$ Q = m \times l$$

## Conduction, convection, radiation
- conduction
	- is the flow of thermal energy through matter from places of higher temperature to places of lower temperature without movement of the matter as a whole
- convection
	- is the flow of heat through a fluid from places of higher temperature to places of lower temperature by movement of the fluid itself
- radiation
	- is the flow of heat from one place to another by means of electromagnetic (EM) waves

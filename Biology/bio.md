##  b) Explain the reasons for the unique thermal properties of water

- This causes strong hydrogen bonds to form between the molecules which require more/high amount of energy to break
- Which increases the melting/boiling/latent heat properties

- water is most dense at 4°C due to more regular hydrogen bonding;

# Vectors
Vectors show the magnitude (size) and direction, while scalars show only the magnitude

The sum of vectors can be calculated by the triangle law of vector addition or parallelogram law of vector addition

Negative vector = same magnitude + opposite direction

> X - Y = X + (-Y)

Vectors can be represented with:
- Components, denoted by <>
- Standard basis vectors, with i=x, j=y, k=z

Magnitude of vectors can be represented with || a ||

### Properties of vectors
- commutative
	> a + b = b + a
- associative
	> a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
- existence of identity
	> v + 0 = v
- existence of inverse
	> v + -v = 0

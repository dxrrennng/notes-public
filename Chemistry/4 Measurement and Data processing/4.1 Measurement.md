# 4.1 Measurement

#chemistry

## Uncertainty in measurement

- Measured quantities are never exact, and they always contain some degree of **uncertainty (error)**
- Uncertainty is usually due to the instrument used to make a measurement, which cannot be avoided
- Even the most precise measurement has an uncertainty
- The uncertainty of the measurement is determined by the scale of the measuring device
- The smaller the unit you use to measure with, the more precise the measurement
- In any measurement, the digits that are reliably known are called significant figures/ digits
	- These include the digits known for certain and the last digit has supposedly been rounded off

## Determining the number of significant digits

- Counted quantities are exact and infinite number of significant figures - there is no uncertainty about them
- Trailing zeros are significant
	- if they indicate a measurement
	- if they are indicated to be so using scientific notation

## Q test

- it is a method used to deduce whether a suspected value is an outlier and should be excluded
- the suspected value should be the lowest or the highest value in the set of data
- the test is a way to find outliers in a small data set, which is usually between 3 and 7 data
- it is therefore commonly used in chemistry
- the most commonly used equation is shown below
- the $Q_{exp}$ is then compared with a critical value, $Q$
- If $Q_{exp}$ > $Q$, the suspected value is an outlier

## Propagation of uncertainties

- the uncertainty is sometimes called the **absolute uncertainty** or **absolute error**
- when adding or subtracting measurements, the total absolute uncertainty/ error are calculated by adding up all of the uncertainties
- the total absolute uncertainty/ error of an average value is the average of individual uncertainties

## Percentage uncertainty

- when multiplying and dividing measurements, the absolute uncertainties/ error must be converted to percentage uncertainty/ error

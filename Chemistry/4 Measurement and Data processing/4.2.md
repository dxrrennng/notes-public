## Variables in an experiment
- controlled variables - variables that are kept constant throughout the experiment
- independent variable (x) - variable that is changed in a controlled way during the experiment
- dependent variable (y) - variable that is tested and measured during the experiment
## Graphs
- the effect of the independent variable has on a dependent variable can be communicated effectively by graphing techniques
- the IB distinguishes between two types of graphs: sketch graphs and drawn(plotted) graphs
- sketch graphs are used to show variables that are proportional or inversely proportional to each other
- the axes on sketch are labelled but unscaled 
- drawn graph show vertical uncertainty
- drawn graph should have
	- title
	- labelled axes, including units
	- appropriate choice of scale for each axis
	- a minimum of five plotted data points
	- a line of best fit (straight line or curve) wherever possible
## graphical techniques - interpolation
- interpolation involves determining an unknown value with in the limits of the values already measured
## graphical techniques - extrapolation
- extrapolation is used to determine an unknown value that lies outside the range of values measured
## graphical techniques - gradient
- measuring a gradient by taking the tangent is particularly useful to determine the rate of a reaction at time t

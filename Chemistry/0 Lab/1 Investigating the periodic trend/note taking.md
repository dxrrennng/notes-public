conclusion then analysis

Mg - universal indicator near the ribbons changes from yellow to blue, no pop sound is recorded; bubbles around Mg ribbons

Ca – effervescence occurs, fizzling, universal indicator changes to blue instantly, colourless gas bubbles form
Ca – Pop sound: hydrogen gas evident
Ca – solution turns milky blue – Ca(OH)2 milky solution (limewater) [reacting with CO2 in air]
	
Mg + HCl (1.0m)
Immediate reaction
Sizzling sound
Effervescence
Colourless gas bubbles
Vigorous (compared to A)
Immediate pop sound
Hydrogen gas observed instantly
Warm test tube

Ca + HCl (1.0m)
Immediate reaction
Sizzling sound
Even more reactive than Mg+HCl
Smoke observed
Solution turns white/milky (calcium hydroxide)
Immediate pop sound (hydrogen) – even louder than Mg
Hot test tube

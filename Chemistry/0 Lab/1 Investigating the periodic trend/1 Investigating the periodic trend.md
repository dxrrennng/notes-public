## Conclusion
### Part 1: To investigate the properties and the reactivity of Group I metals with water (demo)

Regarding the rate of metals dissolving in water, Lithium takes the longest, then Sodium, then Potassium.
This proves that the reactivity of Group I metals generally increases down the group.
This can be explained by the increase of atomic radius due to the increasing number of occupied electron shell.
The electrostatic force of attraction between the positive nucleus and the valence electron decreases, thus the energy required to remove the valence electron decreases, resulting in more ionization energy required for Lithium to remove the valence electron than Potassium.

The colour change of universal indicator from greenish-blue to blue can be explained by the reaction.
The metal hydroxides, which are formed from the reaction, are alkaline, thus causing the universal indicator changes colour to show the increase of pH value.

The paraffin oil is removed from Group I elements with filter paper for the elements to react with water.

### Chemical equations for Part 1
Lithium and water:
$\ce{2Li(s) + 2H2O(l) -> 2LiOH(aq) + H2(g)}$
Sodium and water:
$\ce{2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)}$
Potassium and water:
$\ce{2K(s) + 2H2O(l) -> 2KOH(aq) + H2(g)}$

### Part 2: To investigate the properties and the reactivity of Group II metals with water

For the group II metals, magnesium reacts with water at a very slow rate, with little gas bubble evolving from the magnesium ribbon.
Calcium reacts with water more vigorously than magnesium, with more gas bubble evolving from calcium granules than magnesium ribbon.
This proves that the reactivity of Group II metals generally increases down the group.
This can be explained by the increase of atomic radius due to the increasing number of occupied electron shell.
The electrostatic force of attraction between the positive nucleus and the 2 valence electrons decreases, thus the energy required to remove the 2 valence electrons decreases, resulting in more ionization energy required for Magnesium to remove the valence electrons than Calcium.

A 'pop' sound can be heard from test tube B when the burning splint test is done.
This is caused by an explosion when the hydrogen gas produced from the reaction and oxygen in the air combusts.
The absence of 'pop' sound from test tube A can also prove that calcium and water react more vigorously as more hydrogen gas is produced from the reaction.

However, the group II element react less vigorously than the group I elements.
There are 2 valence electrons in group II elements while there is 1 valence electron in group I elements.
As it requires more energy to remove 2 electrons than removing 1 electron from the outermost electron shell, group I elements are generally more reactive than group II elements.

The colour change of universal indicator from yellow-green to blue can be explained by the reaction.
The metal hydroxides, which are formed from the reaction, are alkaline, thus causing the universal indicator changes colour to show the increase of pH value.

Solution in test tube B turning milky can be explained by one of the product formed by the reaction, calcium hydroxide.
As calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, calcium carbonate is formed, which makes the solution milky.

### Chemical equations for Part 2
Magnesium and water:
- $\ce{Mg(s) + 2H2O(l) -> Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)}$

Calcium and water:
- $\ce{Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) -> Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)}$

_Formation of Calcium Carbonate:_
- $\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)}$

### Part 3: To investigate the reactivity of Group II elements with acid

Test tube C and D reacts more vigorously than test tube A and B.
This shows that the rate of reaction for Group II elements and hydrochloric acid is higher than Group II elements and water.

Test tube D have more gas bubble evolving than test tube C.
This further proves that the reactivity of Group II increases down the group.

A 'pop' sound can be heard from both test tube C and D when the burning splint test is done.
This is caused by an explosion when the hydrogen gas produced from the reaction and oxygen in the air combusts.

Both test tube C and D became hot during the reaction.
This is due to the reaction of Group II elements and acid being exothermic.

Test tube D turns milky after reaction, which might be caused by one of the unwanted product from the reaction, Calcium hydroxide, which is formed from the calcium and the water used to dilute the hydrochloric acid. 
As the calcium hydroxide produced from the aforementioned reaction reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, calcium carbonate is formed, which makes the solution milky. 

### Chemical equations for Part 3
Magnesium and 1.0M hydrochloric acid:
$\ce{Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
Calcium and 1.0M hydrochloric acid:
$\ce{Ca(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> CaCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
_Formation of Calcium hydroxide and Calcium Carbonate_:
$\ce{Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) -> Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)}$
$\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)}$

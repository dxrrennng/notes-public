## Formation of Covalent Bond
- Covalent bond is formed by sharing of electrons between non-metallic elements.
- When atoms of non-metallic conbine chemically, both of them tend to gain electrons to complete octet or duplet structure.
- Covalent bond is the strong directional electrostatic attractive force between the shared electrons and the two nuclei of the bonded atoms.
- The covalent bond formed between two atoms can be single, double or triple depending on the number of shared pairs of electrons.
>Single covalent bond → Chlorine Cl2 ![[chlorine.png|500]]
>Double covalent bond → Oxygen O2 ![[oxygen.png|500]]
>Triple covalent bond → Nitrogen N2 ![[nitrogen.png|500]]
- The shared pairs of outermost shell electrons are known as bond pairs, whereas the unshared pairs are called lone pairs.
- A dative covalent bond is a covalent bond in which more or all of the shared electrons are contributed by one of the bonded atoms only.
- The nature of a dative covalent bond is equal to all other ordinary covalent bonds. It is only different in the formation process.
 >Dative covalent bond → Hydronium ion H3O+ ![[hydronium_ion.png|500]]

## Formulae and naming of covalent substances
- The chemical formula of a covalent substance provides the information about the types of atoms and ratio of the number of different types of atom involved.
- There are two ways to express the chemical formula of a covalent substance, molecular formula and structural formula.
- The molecular formula of a covalent substance reflects the actual number of each kind of atoms in one molecule of the substance, such as CCl4.
- The structural formula of a covalent substance reflects the bonding structure of the constituent atoms in one molecule of the substance.
>Structural formula → Carbon tetrachloride CCl4 ![[carbon_tetrachloride.png|500]]
- The naming of covalent substances depends on whether the substance contains more than one kind of element.
	- If the covalent substance consists of only one kind of element, it is named as the name of the element, such as Hydrogen → H2, Nitrogen → N2, Oxygen → O2
	- If the covalent substance consists of different kind of elements, it is named in the form of a combination of the names of involved elements starting with the less electronegative element and followed by the more electronegative one. The most electronegative element involved usually end with a suffixe '-ide', such as Carbon dioxide --> CO2, Nitrogen monoxide --> NO, Phosphorus pentachloride --> PCl5
	- There are some exceptions that common names are used such as water and ammonia. Naming of organic molecules are also exceptions, such as Water --> H2O, Ammonium --> NH4, Glucose --> C6H12O6, Ethanol --> C2H5OH

## Structure of covalent substances
- There are two major kinds of structure of covalent substances.
- Giant covalent structure
	- Regarding a few elements such as diamond (carbon), graphite (carbon) and quartz (silicon dioxide), they have a giant covalent structure in which covalent bonds bind the non-metal atoms together throughout the whole covalent structure.
	>Diamond (Carbon) ![[diamond.png|500]]
	>Quartz (Silicon dioxide) ![[silicon_dioxide.png|500]]
	>Graphite (Carbon) ![[graphite.png|500]]
- Simple molecular structure
	- Other covalent substances have a simple molecular structure in which strong covalent bonds bind atoms together within a molecule and there are weak van der Waal's forces (London dispersion forces) attracting discrete molecules in a covalent substances

	>Water H2O ![[water_force.png|500]]

## Simple molecular structures and their properties
- Intermolecular forces exist naturally between molecules.
- Discrete molecules are held together by weak van der Waal's forces.
>Iodine I2 ![[iodine_force.png|500]]
- Most covalent substances exist in simple molecular structure.
>Iodine crystal ![[iodine_crystal.png|500]]
- There are two main factors affecting the strength of intermolecular forces: the difference of electronegativity ^[the tendency to pull electron] between atoms in molecules and the molecular size.
- The direct physical outcome of strong intermolecular forces in simple molecular structure is high melting and boiling point. This is because more energy is required to overcome the intermolecular forces among molecules during the process of melting and boiling.
- The physical properties of substances with simple molecular structures depend mainly on to factors: strength of intermolecular forces and polarity of the molecules.
	- Molecular substances may exist as solid, liquid or gas at room temperature and pressure. It depends on the melting and boiling points, which are determined by the strength of intermolecular forces. They have relatively low melting and boiling points when compared to substances with other structures.
	- They are generally soft and brittle due to weak intermolecular forces among molecules.
	- Molecular substances, except water itself, are generally insoluble in water and soluble in many non-aqueous solvents such as ethanol and ether. Their solubility depends on the polarity of the molecules.
	- They do not conduct electricity because of the absence of mobile electrons.

## Giant covalent structures and their properties
- Some non-metallic elements and compounds have a giant covalent structure.
	- In a giant covalent structure, atoms are joined together by directional and strong covalent bonds to construct a giant lattice. They are giant structures because their simplest unit can repeat itself to expand its lattice structure up to infinitely large theoretically. However, due to atmospheric pressure, they are found with finite sizes.
	- Common examples of substances with a giant covalent structure include diamond, graphite and quartz (silicon dioxide).
	- Diamond is an allotrope ^[structurally different forms of the same element] of carbon element. Each carbon atom in the giant lattice is bonded to four neighbouring carbon atoms with C-C single bonds. The bondin geometry is tetrahedrally oriented and repeats itself to form a giant lattice. Diamond is known to be the hardest substance found in nature with high melting and boiling points.
	- Graphite is another allotropic form of carbon. Each carbon atom is bonded to three co-planar carbon atoms with strong C-C single bonds. The plane of carbon atoms repeats the planar bonding geometry to form a hexagonal layer of carbon atoms. The adjacent layers are held together by weak van der Waal's forces. Three of the outermost shell electrons of carbon atoms are shared in the C-C single bonds whereas the remaining one is delocalized along the space between the adjacent layers of atoms. Graphite is knon to be strong within a layer due to strong covalent bonds between atoms. It conducts electricity along the dirction of layers due to the presence of mobile electrons.
	- Quartz is a solid crystalline form of silicon dioxide. Eache silicon atom in the lattice is bonded tetrahedrally to four adjacent oygen atoms while each oxygen atom is bonded to two adjacent silicon atoms with strong Si-O single bonds. The giant lattice resembles the one of diamond. As the number ratio of silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 to 2, the chemical formula of silicon dioxide is ritten as SiO2.
- The physical properties of substances with giant covalent structures depend mainly on their strong covalent bonds between atoms. Substances with giant covalent structures exist as solid at room temperature and pressure because of their high melting and boiling points due to strong covalent bonds between atoms.
- They are strong and hard except graphite. Graphite is brittle because its hexagonal layers of atoms can be separated easily by breaking the weak van der Waal's attraction between layers of atoms.
- They are insoluble in water nor any non-aqueous solvents.
- They are electrical insulators due to the absence of mobile electrons, except for graphite.

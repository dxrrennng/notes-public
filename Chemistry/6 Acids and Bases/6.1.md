## Arrhenius acid-base theory

- Arrhenius acids give hydronium ions, $\ce{H3O+(aq)}$ or hydrogen ions, $\ce{H+(aq)}$ after dissolving in water
	- eg $\ce{HCl, HNO3, CH3COOH, H2SO4}$
- Arrhenius bases give hydroxide ions, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ in water
	- eg $\ce{NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2}$

## Acid dissociation
- when an acid dissolves in water, the acid molecule react with H2O molecules by giving out a hydrogen ion, to form hydronium ions, H3O+ and an anion
	- eg $\ce{HCl(aq) + H2O(l) -> H3O+(aq) + Cl-(aq)}$

## Proticity of acids
- 'Proticity' refers to the number of moles of hydrogen ions/ protons produced per mole of acid molecules when dissolved in water
- Monoprotic acids produce one mole of $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions per mole of acid molecules
	- examples: $\ce{HCl(aq), HNO3(aq), CH3COOH(aq)}$
- Polyprotic acids - diprotic acids produce two moles of H+(aq) ions and triprotic acids produce three moles of H+(aq) ions per mole of molecules
	- eg $\ce{H2So4(aq)}$ (diprotic) and $\ce{H3PO4(aq)}$ (triprotic)
- The acids dissociate step by step to give the corresponding number of H+ ions
	- eg
	- step 1 $\ce{H2SO4(aq) + H2O(l) -> HSO4-(aq) + H3O+(aq)}$
	- step 2 $\ce{HSO4-(aq) + H2O(l) <--> H2SO4^{2-}(aq) + H3O+(aq) }$
	- overall $\ce{H2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l)->H2SO4^{2-}(aq) + 2H3O+(aq)}$

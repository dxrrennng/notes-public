# 3.3 Metallic bonding

#chemistry

## Metallic bonding

- For any metal atoms, the valence electrons are **loosely held** by the nucleus due to
- They can then **overcome** the nuclear attraction easily and become **delocalized**, leaving **positive metal ions**
- **Metallic bonding is the electrostatic force of attraction between positive metal ions and the sea of delocalized electron**
- The valence electrons are not shared between two atoms, but they float "freely" through the giant lattice of metal ions

## Physical properties

### Melting and boiling points

- High melting point due to strong metallic bonding
- Melting points decreases down the group 1, 2 and 13
  - ionic radius increases down the group
  - causing charge density to decrease
  - electrostatic force of attraction between positive metal ions and the sea of delocalised electron decreases
  - less energy is required to overcome the force
  - therefore melting points decrease down the group
- Melting points increase from group 1 to 13
  - affected by two factors
    1. charge of metal ion
       - as the charge on metal ion becomes greater
       - stronger electrostatic force of attraction to the delocalised electrons
       - larger amount of energy is required to break the attraction
       - therefore increasing melting point
    2. number of valence electrons per metal atom
       - Number of delocalised electrons per atom increases
       - stronger electrostatic force of attraction to the delocalised electrons
       - larger amount of energy is required to break the attraction
       - therefore increasing melting point

### Electrical conductivity

- Metals are good conductors of electricity
- When an electrical circuit is closed, a voltage is set up, the delocalised electrons will be able to move in one direction (from negative to positive)

### Malleablility and ductility

- **Malleability** refers the ability of being reshaped under pressure
- **Ductility** refers to the ability of being pulled out into wires
- When a force is applied to a piece of metal,
  - the layers of metal cations can slide past one another
  - without breaking the metallic bonds because the delocalised electrons still hold the metal cations together

## Alloys

- Alloys are solid solutions (mixtures) of a metal with other elements
- Ions of the different metals scattered through the lattice are bound by the delocalized electrons with metallic bonds
- Alloys have properties that are distinct from their component elements

## Particle diagram

- Metal cations have different ionic sizes, thus the regular packing of the metal cations is distorted
- Layers of metal cations slide less easily

### Enhanced properties of alloys

1. Increased strength
2. Decreased malleability and ductility
3. Lower electrical conductivity (movement of delocalised electrons affected)

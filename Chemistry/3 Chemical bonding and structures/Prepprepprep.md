## Describe the bonding and structure of giant ionic lattice, simple molecular structure and giant metallic structure

### Ionic lattice

- Ionic bonding
	- electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions
- giant 3d lattice structure

### Simple molecular structure

- Intramolecular force
	- Covalent bonding
		- electrostatic force of attraction between positive nuclei and shared pair of electrons
- Intermolecular force
	- LDF (London dispersion force)
	- Permanent dipole-dipole attraction
	- Hydrogen bonding
- Simple molecular structure

### Giant metallic structure

- Metallic bonding
	- electrostatic force of attraction between metalcation and sea of delocalized electrons
- giant 3d lattice structure

## Explain the volatility, electrical conductivity and melting/ boiling points of ionic compounds in terms of bonding and structure

- Ionic compounds are considered as non-volatile due to the strong electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, which require a large amount of energy to overcome the strong bonds
- Ionic compounds are **conductive in molten or aqueous state** due to the presence of mobile ions which can move to conduct electricity while they are **non-conductive in solid state** due to the ions held firmly in the lattice structure and the ions are fixed.
- Ionic compounds have a high melting and boiling point due to the strong electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, which require a large amount of **heat** energy to overcome the strong bonds

## Explain the volatility, electrical conductivity and melting/ boiling points of simple molecular substances in terms of bonding and structure

- Simple molecular substances are volatile due to the less energy required to overcome the intermolecular forces when compared to metallic bonding or ionic bonding
- Most simple molecular substances are electrically non-conductive due to the absence of mobile charges except aqueous acids, as they dissociate in water to give mobile ions
- Simple molecular substances have lower boiling and melting point due to the weak intermolecular forces when compared with metallic bonding or ionic bonding

## Explain the electrical conductivity, melting/ boiling points and malleability/ ductility of metals and alloys in terms of bonding and structure

- Alloys have a lower electrical conductivity than metals due to the movement of delocalized electrons affected by the distorted packing of the metal cations
- Metals and alloys have a high melting and boiling point due to the strong electrostatic force between metal cations and sea of delocalized electrons
- Alloys are less malleable and less ductile than metals due to the layers of metal cations slide less easily

### Compare the physical properties of steel and iron

- Steel have an increased strength, decreased malleability and ductility and lower electrical conductivity
- Due to the metal cations have different ionic sizes, thus the regular packing of the metal cations is distorted and layers of metal cations slide less easily

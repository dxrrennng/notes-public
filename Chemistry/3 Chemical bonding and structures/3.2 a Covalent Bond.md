# Covalent bond

#chemistry

## Covalent bond

- atoms of non-metals achieve duplet or octet structure by sharing electrons with each other
- both non-metals have relatively large ionization energy and neither non-metal atom wants to lose its valence electron
- electrostatic force of attraction beteen shared pair of electrons and positive nuclei

## Elements as covalent molecules

- most of the non-metal elements exist as diatomic molecules except noble gases

## Relationship between group number and number of covalent bonds formed

| Group | Valence electrons | Bonding pairs | Lone pairs |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 14    | 4                 | 4             | 0          |
| 15    | 5                 | 3             | 1          |
| 16    | 6                 | 2             | 2          |
| 17    | 7                 | 1             | 3          |

## Covalent bond length and strength

- Bond length
  - the ==distance between the nuclei of the two bonding atoms joined by covalent bond== (r1+r2)
- Bond strength
  - the ==strength of electrostatic force between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the two bonding atoms==
- Bond strength can be measured in terms of bond energy (kJ mol-1)
- It is the energy required to break one mole of covalent bonds from gaseous molecules
- as the atomic radius increases, the bond length increases
- the shared pair of electrons in the covalent bond are further away from the nuclei of the to bonding atoms
- weaker electrostatic force of attraction --> weaker covalent bond --> lower bond energy
- bond order = no. of shared pairs electrons in a bond
- as the number of shared pair electrons in the covalent bond increases, the electrostatic force of attraction from the nuclei increases
- the atoms are held closer and so the covalent bond is shorter and stronger
- bond strength: triple bond > double bond > single bond

## Lewis structure

1. identify the total number of valence electrons
2. identify both central atom and surrounding atoms of the species and arrange the 'skeleton' of the species
3. put the valence electrons to the 'skeleton' of the species as bonding electrons in such a way that the surrounding atoms can form the expected number of covalent bonds
4. put the remaining valence electrons to the surrounding atoms as their lone pair of electrons in such a way that they can achieve octet structure of electrons; if some still remain, put to the central atom as its lone pair

## Incomplete octets

- some atoms, like Berylium and Boron, form stable compounds with incomplete octets
- they prefer to form covalent bond rather than ionic bond because of their comparatively ==high ionization energies==

## Dative covalent bonds

- to achieve octet structure in atoms like Be and B, they form dative covalent bond
- a covalent bond which both electrons in the shared pair are contributed by the same atom
- dative covalent bond is also formed when species ith lone pair electrons, such as ammonia and water, reacting with hydrogen ion ($\ce{H+}$)
  - $\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+}$
- dative covalent bond is also found in carbon monoxide

## Naming and Formula of covalent compounds

- limited to the binary covalent compounds formed between two different non-metals

1. the first element written in the formula should be named first using its full name
2. the second element in the formula should be named after the first one with the suffix of '-ide'
3. prefix should be included to indicate the number of each atom present in the molecule
4. if the number of atom of the first element is one, then no prefix is needed

## Acids

- a group of covalent compounds that dissociate to give ions when dissolved in water
  1. hydro-acids
     - acids that do not contain oxygen
     - $\ce{HCl(aq)}$
  2. oxo-acids
     - acids contaning oxygen
     - $\ce{HNO3(aq)}$

## Organic compounds

- large separate group of covalent compounds which are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms
- the carbon chain serves as the skeleton of the molecules
- some organic compounds also contain oxygen, nitrogen, halogens and/or sulphur atoms too
- carbon compounds that are not classified as organic compounds:
  - carbon monoxide
  - carbon dioxide
  - carbonates
  - hydrogencarbonates
  - cyanides

## VSEPR Theory

- valence shell electron pair repulsion theory
- electron domains are arranged to achieve ==minimum repulsion and maximum separation==
- ==each multiple bond is treated as just one bond region==
- the repulsion decreases in the following order
  - lone pair-lone pair
  - lone pair-bonding pair
  - bonding pair-bonding pair
- this theory is applied to predict the shape of a molecular species
- it states that the bonding atoms in a molecule will achieve a geometry(shape) around the central atom in the valence shell

## Electron Domains

- bonding regions + lone pairs
- determines the electron (domain) geometry

## Electronegativity

- the ability of an atom to attract the shared pair of electrons in a covalent bond
- factors of EN value
  - no. of protons
  - no. of occupied electron shells
  - effect of increasing number of occupied electron shells outweighs the effect of increasing number of protons
  - the nuclear attraction will decrease thus EN value decreases down the group
- ==EN value decreases down the group and increases across the period==
- Pauling scale

## Polar covalent bonds

- the more electronegative atom will draw the bonding pair of electrons towards itself â†’ it will have a partial negative charge ($\ce{\delta -}$)
- the less electronegative atom will have a partial positive charge ($\ce{\delta +}$)
- the pair of partial opposite charges is known as a dipole
- polar covalent bonds are caused by an uneven sharing of electrons ($\ce{\Delta EN > 0.4}$)
- non-polar covalent bond is caused by no difference in EN ($\ce{\Delta EN < 0.4}$)

## Polarity of covalent bonds

- the greater the EN difference between two elements, the more polar a covalent bond is
- Dipole moment is used to quantitatively measure the bond polarity or molecular polarity (units: Debye, D)

## Electronegativity difference and ionic bond

- if there is a large difference in electronegativity of the two atoms in a molecule, the least electronegative atom's electron will transfer to the other atom
- this in turn leads to an ionic bond ($\ce{\Delta EN > 1.7}$)

## Electronegativity difference and the type of bond

- $\ce{\Delta EN < 0.4}$ = Non-polar covalent
- $\ce{0.4 < \Delta EN < 1.7}$ = Polar covalent
- $\ce{\Delta EN > 1.7}$ = Ionic bond
- increasing ionic character as $\ce{\Delta EN}$ increases
- Polarisation
  - the process of forming polar covalent bond

## Polarity of molecule

- not every molecule with polar bonds is polar itself
- dipoles have directions and they can cancel each other out when they are in opposite directions - no net dipoles
- as a result the molecule is non-polar
- arrow "dipole moment"

## Molecule

1. made up of 2 or more atoms chemically combined
2. in a definite no. and ratio of atoms

## Intramolecular Force

- intramolecular force = covalent bond

## Intermolecular Force

- the electrostatic attraction force between molecules or non-metal atoms (noble gases)
- they are much weaker when compared with ionic bond and covalent bond
- its existence is independent of the strength of covalent bond holding the bonding atoms together within a molecule

## Types of intermolecular force

- intermolecular forces account for the physical states as well as some physical properties (eg melting and boiling points and density)
- Hydrogen bonding
- van der Waals' force
  - London dispersion
  - Permanent dipole - dipole moment

## London dispersion force

- also known as instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attraction
- electrostatic attraction in all molecules (no matter they are polar or non-polar) and non-metal atoms
- random movement of electrons causes a temporary dipole
- the electron distribution of the nearby atom or molecule will be disturbed, causing an induced dipole
- strength of London dispersion force depends on the number of electrons (or the molecular mass) of the molecule or the atom
- increasing number of electrons, more probable to form an instantaneous dipole with a larger size, stronger London dispersion force

## Dipole-dipole attractions

- the electrostatic attraction between polar molecules
- the more polar a molecule, the stronger this attraction
- stronger intermolecular force than London dispersion force

## Hydrogen bonding

- a special type of dipole-dipole attraction that occurs when there is a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom X (X can be N, O, F) in the molecules
- in this situation, the hydrogen atom becomes highly electropositive, which strongly attracts to the lone pair of electrons on atom X in the other molecule

## QnA

#### Explain London dispersion force

1. random movement of electrons
2. instantaneous/ temporary dipole
3. induced dipole on neighbouring molecule

## Physical properties of molecular substances

### Electrical conductivity

- Most simple molecular substances **do not conduct** electricity as they do not contain mobile charges
- However, **aqueous acids** can conduct electricity as the molecules can **dissociate** in water to give **mobile ions**
  - eg. $\ce{H-Cl(aq) -> H+ + Cl-}$
  - $\ce{H2SO3(aq) -> H+ + HSO3-}$ ^[$\ce{HSO3-}$ is hydrogensulphite ion]
- mobile charges = mobile ions + mobile electrons

### Boiling and melting points

- Generally **low** due to the **weak** intermolecular forces
- Depending on the **type** of intermolecular force as well as the **molecular mass**
- Relative strengths:
  - **London dispersion force < Dipole-dipole attractions < Hydrogen bonding**

Comparing ethanol and ethanoic acid's boiling point, ethanoic acid $\ce{C=O}$ and $\ce{O-H}$ bonds while ethanol only has $\ce{O-H}$ bond, therefore ethanoic acid is more polar.

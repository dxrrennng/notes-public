## Molecular geometry

### State and explain shapes of molecules
1.  state the no. of e- domains + no. of bonding regions + no. of lone pairs
2.  e- pairs repel in max separation and reach min repulsion
3.  if have lone pairs - lone pair repulsion > bond pair repulsion
4.  shape and bond angle

### Explain polarity of molecules (non-polar)
1. polar bonds
2. symmetrical (all bonds identical and no lone pairs)
3. dipoles are cancelled out

### Explain polarity of molecules (polar) 
1. polar bonds
2. asymmetrical (not all bonds identical or has lone pairs)
3. has net dipole

### Explain formation of London dispersion force
1. random movement of electrons
2. instantaneous dipole
3. induced dipole in neighbouring molecule

More e- stronger LDF

### Explain formation of hydrogen bonding
1. covalent bond between H and N/O/F
2. Strong electrostatic attraction between $\ce{\delta+ H}$ on one molecule and the lone pair electrons on slightly negative $\ce{\delta- N / O / F}$ atom on another molecule (weak when compared to ionic/ covalent bond)

### Compare the melting/ boiling points of two covalent molecules
1. state the major IMF in each of the molecule
2. compare the strength of the IMF

###### Example: compare the boiling points of water and methane
1. Hydrogen bondings in water ==between molecules== while LDF in methane ==between molecules==
2. Hydrogen bonding is stronger than LDF
3. Boiling point of water is higher than methane

###### Example 2: compare the boiling points of methane and propane
1. Methane and propane both only have LDF ==between molecules==
2. Propane has more electrons
3. Stronger LDF in propane
4. Boiling point of Propane is higher than methane

 ### Compare the boiling point of ethanol and methanol
 1. Methanol and ethanol both have hydrogen bonding as their major IMF between molecules due to the presence of $\ce{O-H}$ bond
 2. Ethanol has more electrons
 3. Stronger London dispersion force in Ethanol between molecules
 4. Thus Boiling point of ethanol is higher than methanol

# Chemical bonding and structures

#chemistry

## Ionic bonding

- electrostatic force of attraction between ions

## Octet rule

- atoms of elements tend to combine in such a way that they have eight electrons in their outermost/ valence electron shell, giving them the same electron arrangement as a noble gas
- they achieve this by either transferring electrons or sharing electrons

## Ionic compounds

- metal atoms have relatively lower ionization energy than that of non-metal atoms
- metal atoms lose electrons to become cations
- non-metal atoms gain electrons to become anions

## Ionic structure

- the positively and negatively charged ions are held together in a giant lattice^[regular 3D arrangement with infinite ions] by many strong ionic bonds

## Naming of ionic compounds

- when naming an ionic compound, cation should be named first and followed by anion
- no prefix needed to indicate the number of ions in the compound
- the charge of transition metal cations (several possible charges) should be shown as a roman numeral in a bracket
- it is noted that the formula of the ionic compound should show electrical neutrality
- the total positive charge from the cation should be the same as the total negative charge from the anion
- if the ion is polyatomic and more than one of this ion are present in the formula, a bracket should be written across the formula of the ion and the number should then be written on the lower right hand outside the bracket

## Physical properties of ionic compounds

- physical properties such as melting and boiling points, electrical conductivity and solubility of a substance depend on
  - type of structure
  - the type of constituent species
  - the type (the strength) of attraction between constituent species

## High melting point and boiling point

| Ionic compound | Melting point/ degC | Boiling point/ degC |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| $\ce{NaCl}$    | 801                 | 1413                |
| $\ce{Na2O}$    | 1132                | 1950                |

- ionic compounds are solids under ambient conditions^[(25degC and 1 atm)]
- strong electrostatic force of attractions between the oppositely charged ions (ionic bond) in its lattice
- large amount of heat energy is required to break the many strong bonds

## Volatility

- tendency of a substance to vaporize
- ionic compounds have low volatility or are considered as being non-volatile

## Electrical conductivity

movement of charges, eg electrons, ions, are needed to conduct electricity

- solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity
  - ions are held firmly (fixed) in the lattice
- molten/ liquid ionic compound conduct electricity
  - mobile ions move to conduct electricity
- aqueous ionic compounds (dissolved in water) conduct electricity
  - mobile ions move to conduct electricity

bond = attraction
structure = arrangement
higher charge = stronger ionic bond

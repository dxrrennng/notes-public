outermost shell electrons = valence electrons

## Cations
- when an atom loses electrons, it becomes positively charged, and it is a cation - as the number of protons > electrons

## Anions
- when an atom gains electrons, it becomes negatively charged, and it is an anion - as the number of electrons > number of protons

## Chemical properties
- the loss or gain of electrons makes a very big difference to the chemical properties
- you swallow sodium ions, Na+, every time you eat table salt, whereas sodium atoms, Na, are dangerously reactive
- the magnitude of the charge depends on the number of electrons lost or gained
- there is ==no change in the atomic or mass numbers== of an ion because the number of protons and neutrons remains the same

## Arrangement of electrons
- according to the Bohr model of atom, it shows that the electrons in the atoms are situated in certain electron shells or 'energy levels' (occupied electron shells moving around the nucleus)
- each electron shell can only accommodate certain number of electrons and they are at different distance from the nucleus
- the innermost electron shell is filled first
- the outer electron shell will be filled after completely filling up the inner one
- the last occupied electron shell is described as the outermost electron shell
- Bohr found that the closer an electron is to the nucleus, the more energy needed to remove it from the atom, because it is attracted by the nucleus more strongly
- it is opposite to those electrons which are further away from the nucleus
- the arrangement of electrons in an atom hence determines the chemical properties of an element

## Noble gases
- eg. helium, neon, argon
- stable and inert
- eight or two electrons in their outermost electron shell
- atoms, with an electron arrangement of noble gas (full outermost shell), will exhibit extra stability

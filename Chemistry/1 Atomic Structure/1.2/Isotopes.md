# Properties of isotopes
#chemistry 
- isotopes have the ==same chemical properties== as chemical reactions depend on the number of electrons
- difference in atomic mass leads to ==different physical properties== such as boiling and melting points 
- heavier isotopes move more slowly at a given temperature and therefore have higher melting and boiling points (harder to break apart)

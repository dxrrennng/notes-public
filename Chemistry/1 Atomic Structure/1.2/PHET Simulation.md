-  the alpha particles (positively charged) are repelled by the positive nucleus in the gold and calcium atoms
- and deflected/ bounced/ reflected away

| Atom    | Energy | Interaction                                         |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gold    | Min    | have the largest degree of repulsion and deflection |
| Gold    | Max    | less repulsion and deflection than gold - min       |
| Calcium | Max    | have the least repulsion and deflection             |
| Calcium | Min    | more repulsion and deflection than calcium - max    |

# Atomic models and theories - Topic 1 Part 1
#chemistry 
## Democritus
- all matters are composed of 'atoms'
- atoms are ==indivisible==
	- violate as subatomic particles are discovered

## John Dalton
- all matters are made up of ==indestructible== atoms
	- with the discovery of subatomic particles, eg electrons, neutrons and protons, the atom can no longer be considered indivisible
- the atoms of a given element are identical; the atoms of different elements are different in some fundamental ways
	- discovery of isotopes indicated that all atoms of the same element are not perfectly identical, at least they differ in their masses
- chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine with each other; a given compound always has the same relative numbers and types of atoms
- chemical reactions involve rearrangement of the atoms; the atoms themselves are not changed in a chemical reaction
- Dalton's atomic theory could not explain why certain substances, with atoms of the same element, differ in their properties
	- eg, graphite and diamond are made up of only carbon atoms, but their properties are quite different

## JJ Thomson
- used the ==plum pudding/ chocolate chip cookie== model
- atom has no net charge
- different metals produce a stream of negatively charged particles (electrons) when a high voltage is applied across two electrodes
- Thomson's model failed to explain the results of the alpha particle scattering experiment carried out by Rutherford - the majority of the alpha particle passes through the gold foil while a small number of them bounced back
- there was no experimental evidence provided by Thomson, which was one of the major drawbacks of his model

## Rutherford
- used the gold foil experiment
	-  fired ==alpha particles (2 protons and 2 neutrons, nucleus of a helium atom)== to a gold foil
	-  if JJ's model was correct, all of the alpha particles, would land on the back of detector
	-  some of the alpha particles reflected back to the front of the detector, proving that JJ was wrong (the alpha particle hit the nucleus of the gold atoms on the gold foil)
-  one of the drawbacks of the Rutherford model was that he did not say anything about the arrangement of electrons in an atom which made his theory incomplete
-  the existence of neutrons was not known yet

## Niels Bohr
- used the ==Bohr model of hydrogen==
	- seen as a small solar system with electrons orbiting around the nucleus
	- ==electrostatic force of attraction between the oppositely charged subatomic particles prevents the electrons from leaving the atom==
	- ==most of the volume of the atom is empty space==
- given its mass and wavelike nature, the electron in the hydrogen atom could not possibly orbit the nucleus in a well-defined circular path as predicted by Bohr
- the position (orbit of a particular radius) and the energy of the electron could not be specified

## Heisenberg
- uncertainty principle
	- the accurate position and the momentum of a particle cannot be measured with absolute precision

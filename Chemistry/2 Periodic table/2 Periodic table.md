## Block naming
s block → hydrogen, group 1, 2
p block → group 13-18
d block → group 3-12
f block → lanthanoid series, actinoid series

- number of ==occupied== electron shells

## Group 1, 2, 13
- Group 1, group 2 and group 13 elements except Boron are metals which show the physical properties such as shiny appearance, malleable, ductile, good electrical and thermal conductivity
- when reacted, they tend to lose electrons to form cations

## Group 14, 15, 16, 17
- most of the elements in groups 14 to 17 are non-metals which lack distinctive physical properties that characterize them
- most of them are poor conductors of heat and electricity
- when they react, they tend to gain electrons to form anions

## Metalloids
- boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium, polonium
- they have properties in between those of metals and non-metals
- typical metalloids have a metallic appearance, but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity
- chemically, they mostly behave as non-metals

## Transition metals
- found in [[2 Periodic table#Block naming | d block]]
- have similar properties to those of metals, with some specific properties
- 
| Physical properties                      | Chemical properties                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| high electrical and thermal conductivity | variable charges                   |
| high melting point                       | form a variety of complex ions[^1] |
| malleable                                | form coloured compounds            |
| ductile                                  | act as catalysts                   |

## [[2 Periodic table#Block naming | f block]] elements - Rare earth metals
- Lanthanides (Z = 58 to 71) are reactive, silver coloured metals that tarnish when exposed to air
- Actinides (Z = 89 to 103) are similar to typical metals, but they are radioactive

## Group 18 - Noble gases
- all are colourless gases that are very stable and inert
- exists as monatomic molecule

## Group 1 - Alkali metals
- shiny and silvery
- generally soft and can be easily cut with a knife
- very reactive and should be stored in paraffin oil - to prevent them from contacting with air and moisture
- reactivity increases down the group

## Group 2 - Alkaline earth metals
- show similar properties to those in group 1 but less reactive
- denser and harder than group 1 metals
- reactivity increases down the group

## Reactivity of metals
- reactivity of group 1 and 2 metals increases down the group, because of the increasing trend of atomic radius
- ==Atomic radius is the half of the distance between the nuclei of two neighbouring atoms==
- it refers to the distance from the nucleus to the outermost shell/ valence electrons

## (First) Ionization energy
- **minimum energy required to remove ==1 mol of electrons== from ==1 mol of gaseous atoms==**
- the amount of energy required to remove the outermost shell/valence electron ==decreases== down group 1 and 2
- $\ce{X(g) -> X+(g) + e-}$

## Electron affinity
- **energy released when ==1 mol of gaseous atoms== gain ==1 mol of electrons==**
- when two opposite charges attract or bonds are formed, energy is released
- negative value
- more negative = more energy released
- going down group 17, the attraction between the nucleus and the additional electrons becomes weaker
- in other words, the affinity for an electron decreases
- $\ce{X(g) + e- -> X-(g)}$

## Group 17 - Halogens
- they are all poisonous and reactive non-metals
- they have different colours and physical states under ambient conditions

| Elements | Colour and physical state at ambient conditions |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| fluorine | pale green gas                                  |
| chlorine | pale green gas                                  |
| bromine  | reddish brown liquid                            |
| iodine   | black solid                                     |

## Reactivity of halogens
- reactivity of these elements decreases down the group
- because the atomic radius of these elements increases
- the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the additional electrons becomes weaker

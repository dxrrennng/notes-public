> 1 is Pure compound of $\ce{H2O2}$
> 2 is Mixture of two elements $\ce{H2}$ and $\ce{O2}$
> 3 is Mixture of element $\ce{O}$ and compound $\ce{H2O}$

## Elements

- all substances are made up of certain elements
- An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into further elements

## Compounds

- A compound is formed from two or more different elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio
- Compounds have different properties from the elements that they are made from

## Mixtures

- Mixtures contain more than one element and/or compound that are not chemically bonded together and so retain their individual properties
- Mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous

- A homogeneous mixture has a uniform appearance and composition throughout
	- (eg salt solution, air, alloys)
- A heterogeneous mixture consists of visibly different substances or phases
	- (eg sand and water, soil)

## States of matter

- macroscopic differences
	- shape volume
- microscopic differences
	- arrangement of particles
	- speed of particles
	- attraction forces

> **gas $\ce{->[{deposition}]}$ solid**
> **gas $\ce{<-[{sublimation}]}$ solid**

## Chemical changes

- a chemical change results in the formation of new chemical substances
- In a chemical reaction, the atoms in the reactants are rearranged to form new products

> Solid that appear from mixing 2 solution is called precipitate $\ce{(aq) + (aq) -> (s) + (aq)}$

>Give out light and heat is called combustion/ explosion

### Examples of chemical changes
- **Formation of precipitate**
- **Burning/ combustion**
- Rusting
- Ripening of fruit
- **Explosion**
- **Production of gas**

## Chemical equations
- To balance chemical equations, we can only change the numbers in front of the reactants or products. These are called coefficients.
- State symbols show the physical state (solid, liquid, gas or aqueous) of the reactants and products in a chemical equation

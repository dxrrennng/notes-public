1.  Isopropyl alcohol, sold as rubbing alcohol, is composed of C, H, and O. Combustion of 0.255 g of isopropyl alcohol produces 0.561 g of CO2 and 0.306 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of isopropyl alcohol?
    

m(C in CO2)= 12.01/44.01 x 0.561 = 0.1531 g

Mass of H in H2O = 2.02/18.02 x 0.306 = 0.03430 g

Mass of O in the alcohol = 0.255 - 0.1531 - 0.03430 = 0.06761 g

n(C) = 0.1531/12.01 = 0.01275

n(H) =0.03430/1.01 = 0.03396

n(O) = 0.06761/16.00 = 0.004225

C:H:O = 3.02:8.04:1

C3H8O

2.  The characteristic odor of pineapple is due to ethyl butyrate, a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Combustion of 2.78 mg of ethyl butyrate produces 6.32 mg of CO2 and 2.58 mg of H2O. What is the empirical formula of the compound?
    

3.  Nicotine, a component of tobacco, is composed of C, H, and N. A 5.250 mg sample of nicotine was combusted, producing 14.242 mg of CO2 and 4.083 mg of H2O.  What is the empirical formula for nicotine? If nicotine has a molar mass of 160 ± 5 g mol-1, what is its molecular formula? 
    

  
  
  
  

4.  Menthol, the substance we can smell in mentholated cough drops, is composed of C, H, and O. a 0.1005 g sample of menthol is combusted, producing 0.2829 g of CO2 and 0.1159 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of menthol? If menthol has a molar mass of 156 g mol-1, what is its molecular formula?
    

5.  Washing soda, a compound used to prepare hard water for washing laundry, is a hydrate, which means that a certain number of water molecules are included in the solid structure. Its formula can be written as Na2CO3●xH2O, where x is the number of moles of H2O per mole of Na2CO3. When a 2.558 g sample of washing soda is heated at 25 °C, all the water of hydration is lost, leaving 0.948 g of Na2CO3. What is the value of x?
    

  

6.  Burning a compound of calcium, carbon, and nitrogen in oxygen in a combustion train generates calcium oxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and no other substances. A small sample gives 2.389 g calcium oxide, 1.876 g carbon dioxide, and 3.921 g nitrogen dioxide. Determine the empirical formula of the compound.

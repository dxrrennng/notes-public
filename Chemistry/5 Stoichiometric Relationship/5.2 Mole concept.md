## Relative molecular mass

is the average mass of a molecule relative to 1/12 of the mass of Carbon-12

## Relative formula mass

- the term relative formula mass is used for ionic compounds

## Molar mass
- Molar mass (M) is the mass in grams of one mole of a substance ($\mathrm{g\ mol^{-1}}$)
- To calculate the molar mass, add the relative atomic masses of the atoms in the substance

```ad-question
title: How would the number of atoms in a 1.01 g sample of hydrogen compare to the number of atoms in a 63.55 g sample of copper? Justify your answer.

Hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2}$):
$\text{mol of molecules} = \frac{1.01}{2.02}= 0.5$
$\text{number of atoms} = 0.5 \times 2 \times 6.02\cdot10^{23} = 6.02\times10^{23}$

Copper ($\ce{Cu}$):
$\text{mol of atoms} = \frac{63.55}{63.55} = 1$
$\text{number of atoms} = 6.02\times10^{23}$
```
```ad-question
title: Calculate the mass of one Carbon atom
1 mole of C atoms = 12g
1 C atom = $12/(6.02\times10^{23})$

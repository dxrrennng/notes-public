# 5.3 Formulas

#chemistry

## Molecular formula

- the actual number of each kind of atoms in one molecule of the substanced
- eg. methane $\ce{CH4}$

## Empirical formula

- the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms or ions present
- it is applicable to all kinds of compounds
- eg. methane $\ce{CH4}$, ethene $\ce{CH2}$, glucose $\ce{CH2O}$

## Structural formula

- shows how the consituent atoms join together in a molecule
- It is applicable to molecular elements and compounds
- To determine the strctural formula of a molecule, more analyses should be carried out, such as chemical tests, mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, etc.

## Percentage composition by mass

- percentage by mass of each element in a compound can be calculated from the formula of the compound
	- by comparing the mass of each element present to the mass of the compound in grams
	- by comparing the molar mass of each element to the molar mass of the compound

```ad-example
title: A sample of 60.16 g alkane contains 48.04 g carbon
Mass of carbon = 48.04g
Percentage by mass of C:
$48.04 \div 60.16 \times 100\%$
$=79.9\%$
Percentage by mass of H:
$1-79.9\%$
$=20.1\%$
```

```ad-example
title: In ethanol, which has the formula of $\ce{C2H5OH}$, the percentage by mass of each element present can be calculated from the molar masses:
Mr of C $= 12.01$; Mr of H $= 1.01$; Mr of O $= 16.00$
Percentage by mass of C:
$\frac{12.01\times2}{12.01\times2+1.01\times6+16.00}\times100\%$
$= 52.1\%$
Percentage by mass of H:
$\frac{1.01\times6}{12.01\times2+1.01\times6+16.00}\times100\%$
$= 13.2\%$
Percentage by mass of O:
$1-52.1\%-13.2\%$
$= 34.7\%$
```

```ad-question
title: Calculate the mass percent by mass of nitrogen($\ce{N}$) in ammonium nitrate($\ce{NH4NO3}$).
Mr of N = 14.01; Mr of H = 1.01; Mr of O = 16.00
Percentage by mass of N:
$\frac{14.01\times2}{14.01\times2+1.01\times4+16.00\times3}\times 100\%$
$= 35.0\%$
```

Calculate the mass percent of each element in the following compounds.

1. Calcium carbonate
2. Potassium hydrogencarbonate
3. Magnesium oxide
4. Ammonium sulfate
5. Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate ($\ce{CuSO4*5H2O}$)

```ad-question
title: Calcium carbonate($\ce{CaCO3}$)
Mr of Ca = 40.08; Mr of C = 12.01; Mr of O = 16.00
Percentage by mass of Ca:
$\frac{40.08}{40.08+12.01+16.00\times3}\times100\%$
$= 40.0\%$
Percentage by mass of C:
$\frac{12.01}{40.08+12.01+16.00\times3}\times100\%$
$= 12.0\%$
Percentage by mass of O:
$1- 40.0\% - 12.0\%$
$= 48.0\%$
```

```ad-example
title: Empirical formula: A compound containing iron and sulfur was formed by combining 2.233g of iron with 1.926g of sulfur. What is the empirical formula of the compound?

||Iron|Sulphur|
|---|---|---|
|Mole|0.03998...|0.06006|
|Mole ratio|2|3|
Therefore empirical formula is $\ce{Fe2S3}$

## Determining the formula of MgO

- the crucible is then left to cool and finally the crucible, lid and magnesium oxide residue are reweighed.
	- heat to constant mass

```ad-example
title: Example data
| Raw data                        | mass     |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Crucible and lid                | 21.510 g |
| Crucible and lid with Mg ribbon | 23.860 g |
| Crucible and lid with product   | 25.450 g |
```

| Processed data | mass    |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Mg ribbon      | 2.350 g |
| Oxide          | 1.590 g |

| Step                                                                | Mg         | O          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 mass of various constituent elements (atomic form)                | 2.350g     | 1.590g     |
| 2 mol of each constituent element                                   | 0.09671mol | 0.09938mol |
| 3 relative number of moles (mole ratio)                             | 1.03       | 1          |
| 4 multiply the relative number of moles by a constant, if necessary | 1          | 1          |

Therefore, the ionic formula for magnesium oxide is $\ce{MgO}$.

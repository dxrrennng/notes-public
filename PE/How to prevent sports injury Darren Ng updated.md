Sports injury can be prevented by: wearing the correct gear, perform warm up exercise, and take breaks in between practice sessions.

### Wearing the correct gear

Wearing the correct gear is important for sports injury prevention as it can reduce the chance of hurting yourself.
Take basketball as an example, basketball shoes are necessary for the players as they have to constantly move themselves in the court and make sharp turns. If normal running shoes are worn, players risk over turning their ankle and cause sprained ankles.
Another example is soccer. Soccer player have to wear soft pads on their knees and also wear shoes with studs. This can help them to manoeuvrer in the field without risking sliding.

### Perform warm up before exercise

Performing stretch before exercise can stimulate player's muscles and 'warm up' them.
A warm up routine can help increase bloodflow, raise body temperature, and improve balance, flexibility and coordination. ^[https://www.wakemed.org/care-and-services/childrens-services/education-and-resources/ncfc-and-wakemed-healthy-families/warm-up-and-stretching-exercises]
A good warm up for athletes would be slow jogging, jumping jacks, pushups and situps as different muscles groups are needed to perform the exercise.

### Take breaks in between training sessions

Overworking yourself can cause muscle sprain and lead to other unnecessary injuries.
Take 5 - 10 mins break per 1 hour session can allow the body to 'recharge'.
Athletes should drink water to not risk themselves of dehydration during the intersection breaks.

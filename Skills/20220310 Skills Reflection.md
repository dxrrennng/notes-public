After listening to Ms Luk's sharing on the importance of citations and how to apply MLA citations to our work.
As the creators spend a lot of time in generating experimental data or developing a theory to back up their idea, if we are going to use their experimental data/ theory, we should honour their work.

I've learnt a lot of research skills after the sharing, such as how to prioritize credit over a large team of people with the term "et. al", how to differentiate between a section from a work, and how to properly format with the MLA style. I also learnt how to use different resources online such as citation machine that can auto generate MLA citations.
I've tried to apply the knowledge I've learnt into the exercise Ms Luk provided to us and my result was similar to the results JSTOR generated.
If I have to cite in the future, I'll use the auto generator on the databases or citation machine to prevent myself from the "academic honesty" trap.

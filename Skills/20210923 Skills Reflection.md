After the instructor teaches us how to use the TI calculator properly, I finally find this powerful machine better than the Casio we had previously in the NSS. I was so frustrated when I first got my TI as all the calculations with angles were wrong. I found out that it was due to radians/ degrees conversion, but didn't know how to switch it until today.

I was impressed at how you can save functions as a variable shown by the instructor. By initializing the function with a few variables, I can easily repeat the distance formula without typing out all the square roots.

---

Another thing that surprised me is how the calculator can detect built-in functions from variables. By typing nsolve, it will directly un-italic the word and change it to the numerical solve function.

I felt like not having a qwerty keyboard was a problem to me, as I was too used to the layout. I searched online^[https://www.quora.com/Why-do-graphing-calculators-like-the-TI-Nspire-have-a-keyboard-thats-not-QWERTY] and found out the reason that the keyboard uses an ABC layout instead of qwerty is due to the examination standards like IB and SAT not allowing the qwerty layout.

Maybe I'll get used to it after a few more months of use, I hope.

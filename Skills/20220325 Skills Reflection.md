Ms Dutton's lesson on the Approaches to learning (ATL) skills was very informative and interactive. She talked about how there are sub-skills underneath each of the 5 skills, and also the importance of differentiating each sub-skills from others.

She gave us a pre-task which is to set a virtual background of where I want to be, and I chose 2 backgrounds, one with the 5 FAANG companies and another with a production house as I originally thought that the lesson is on job planning. I always wanted to pursue a dream of technology-related or media-related future.

The skill that I want to master as soon as possible is research skills. As the pre IB year is going to end, and we are faced with EEs and many IAs, the importance of research is increasing and we have to learn it in order to properly credit the author and to not accidentally plagiarize.

This lesson is linked to all the 5 ATL skills, as Ms Dutton clarifies the difference between each of the skills, especially social and communication. Although there are clean boundaries between each of the skills, the 5 ATL skills are interconnected such that to become a good IB student you have to be balanced at all of the 5 skills.

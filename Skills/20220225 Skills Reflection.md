After listening to Mr Cheng's workshop on how to research efficiently, I've learnt many practical skills such as the use of truncation symbol for searching results with unknown suffix, the use of boolean operators 'and', 'or' and 'not' to refine the results that we want. I also familiarized myself with the research process on JStor, Gale and HK Public Library databases.
My trial research topic is on "How to efficiently reduce noise with the use of Active Noise Cancellation technology". The topic is related to physics as the technology behind Active Noise Cancellation is related to the emission of sound wave. I had great result on JStor and Gale but not HKPL. After attending the workshop, I tried to use the boolean operators and the truncation symbol and the results that I want showed way quicker.
This workshop is definitely connected with the research skills out of the 5 ATL Skills. I learnt how to research in reliable sources and also tried MLA and APA citations. I also understood that citing with the wrong format may lead to academic dishonesty.
After this workshop, I'll try to incorporate database searching into my workflow for researching.

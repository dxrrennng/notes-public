I am usually the one who provides the answer when my friends ask for it. After having today's lesson on academic honesty, I understood that this is an action of collusion, as the action assists others to 'take shortcut' to achieve a goal. From now on, I'll just kindly say no to people who ask for answers.

I personally love the picture where families and gangs help the kid inside the examination hall to 'ace' the exam. The invigilators understand the situation but cannot do anything about it, because their life is at risk. Thankfully, this won't happen in our school and everyone can be treated fairly.

After reading the policies again, I found out that the consequences of not just planned misconduct, but also unplanned ones, like forgetting to give credits or using the wrong format to credit, can result in level 1 to 2 punishments.

It scares me as reaching level 2 punishments mean that the plagiarism record will be shown to the universities, and it will definitely affect my chance of getting in the university.

I will trust the turnitin score and edit the assignments if the turnitin score is too low after learning this in the lesson.

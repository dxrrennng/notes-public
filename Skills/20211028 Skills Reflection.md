After listening to the talk given by Mr Cheung, I've learnt to protect myself and others from the risk of leaking any inappropriate photos by just not taking the photos in the first place.
I feel like the implementation of the new 'Anti-voyeurism law' is needed to protect female in the society from being filmed of upskirt images which might be leaked.

I was surprised when Mr Cheung show us the top 20 most visited websites in HK. Seeing that hkjc.com was the 10th most visited website in HK in 2020. It shows how many HK citizens like to gamble.

Mr Cheung introduced us to the three laws, and I was pleased to know that I am being protected by the 'Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance' as the definition of child is people under the age of 16. Any distribution of child pornography is prohibited and banned in HK, and the offenders will be fined and jailed. But even with this ordinance, we should protect ourselves by not falling into the trap of 'sexting' or 'nude chatting'.

After listening to this talk, I will make sure that I won't commit illegal acts on the internet and protect myself by declining any offers of 'sexting' or 'nude chatting'.

After having today's lesson on time management, I decided to start using [a to-do app made by Google](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-screen-for-google-ta/ndbaejgcaecffnhlmdghchfehkflgfkj). I'm still trying to organize my page with the deadlines and the tasks. I believe that my time schedule is more packed than others as I have a lot of duties for clubs and soc. As a chairman of Diocesan Media, not only that I have to arrive the earliest and leave the latest, being in a very important group means that there are stuff to film every week, even every day. From now on, I'll try to increase the portion of self-time by gradually giving task to my 'colleagues' and reduce the time needed for me to stay at school or work on projects.

I totally agree on the video saying that you need a 'sacred place' for studying. I usually have kpop on max volume in front of me when I study, and it has become a habit. Every time the song I love the most plays through the speaker, I'll just stop what I do and have my head bang to the beat.

I am one of those who cram the revision to the last moment. If I know that I understand the topic and there isn't much hard stuff to memorize, I'll start revision on the day before and just read the book once and do past papers. Cramming often works for me, but one time there's a new song release the day before an exam, and instead of revising, I decided to just look at the book and have the song single loop for five hours straight. I still scored decent, but I could have definitely got a higher score if I just pause the music and do more past papers.

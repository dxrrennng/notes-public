After having today's first IB Skills lesson, I learnt that adaptiveness is the key to success in the 21st century, not just pure strength nor pure intelligence. We now live in a world where knowledge can be easily obtained through the internet, and facts can change anytime. Take Pi (the math one) as an example, it has been recently updated with trillions of digits more, thanks to the supercomputer.^[Braine, T. (2021, August 17). _Swiss research TEAM calculates Pi TO 62.8 trillion decimals on supercomputer_. nydailynews.com. https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/ny-swiss-researchers-calculate-pi-trillion-decimals-supercomputer-20210817-uaxwny46m5bs7o7spki6535r5m-story.html.] If scientific companies who create Pi-depending products do not make change to the products, they wouldn't improve, thus they wouldn't survive in this fast-paced world.

I am surprised at how much communication IBDP needs than NSS, the amount of discussion in one skills lesson is equivalent to one week of NSS lessons. I love the process where everyone has different view to one question, and finally compromise to one final answer where everyone can agree to, as we can all learn something from the conversation.

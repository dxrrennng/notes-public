# 20220120 Skills Reflection

### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

#skills #skills/reflections

After Ms Sharon's sharing on stress and anxiety, I learnt to differentiate anxiety from stress and understand that in some situation both terms cannot be used interchangeably.
Stress is acceptable and the correct amount of stress can increase our productivity, but anxiety should be relieved as soon as possible before it causes harm to our wellbeing.
As I enter the second phase of my PreIB life, I start to feel a bit of stress as time goes on as my friends and family have more expectations to my scores and grades.
I hope that I can use the stress as a motivation to improve on my academics.

However, as stress gradually transform into anxiety, I feel like my long term commitments to Media team and people's expectations towards the video's quality is making me feel a little anxious. I am trying to relieve the anxiety by giving some workload to my workmates and also start training some G9 and G8 as they become "dailos".

This is related to the self-management skills, which is one of the 5 ATL skills. If we don't properly relieve our anxiety, it could cause permanent damage to our mental health and wellbeing, e.g. insomnia and even suicidal thoughts.
As Ms Sharon taught us the 4 different kinds of cause for stress and anxiety, we can properly identify the cause and try to relieve with the corresponding measure.

PS to Ms Sharon if you are reading this: your reading pace is varies a bit and also your Cantonese pronunciation especially with the "-t" and "-k" sounds needs to be improved to deliver a higher quality speech. Good luck :)

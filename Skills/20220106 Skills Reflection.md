# 20220106 Skills Reflection

### Ng Cheuk Yin Darren

#skills #skills/reflections

As I was listening to Mr Lee's wonderful talk about love, relationship and consent and filling in the 45 questions on the love triangle, I struggled to enter values as I'm still "A0" and I couldn't think of anyone to fill in the blanks. The three aspects of the triangle were intimacy, passion and commitment. I felt that only these three aspects couldn't fully determine if a relationship is healthy or not.
Mr Lee asked me, is it acceptable if you are still single, A0, during year 3 in university. Haven't fully thought through, I answered that it's acceptable, with the advantage being that I can focus on my study. However, university is the final stage of study and after that we all have to enter workspaces. By then, we won't have the time to find our life-long mate, so if I had to re-answer that question, I would answer the other way.

This is related to self-management. We often talk about time management, how to use your 24 hours wisely, but time management does not only include that. We have to plan different parts of our life to do what we want. Furthermore, we can always readjust the next day if we allocated our 24 hours inefficiently, but we can't retry our life stages as you only live once.

After today's talk, I would not do certain actions if consent is not given, and I hope that I can use skills of managing long-lasting relationship taught by Mr Lee in my daily life.

After listening to the talk from Ms Keung and Ms Lee, I learnt that some 'obstacles' such as economic issues, are actually 'hurdles' and can be easily overcome.
As the world continues to evolve, the subjects that we studied does not have to relate to the job we want to do.

I would say that my reasons to enter university are as follows:
1. pursuing further education in order to obtain professional skills
2. creating a network of connection so that I can become a team player and to develop social skills
3. gaining self-esteem and confidence

I still don't have a job that I must do in mind, but I'm thinking of getting into computer-related companies or small production houses.
The skills required for these jobs such as how to talk with a client aren't taught in DBS.
The only way to learn these soft skills is to communicate more with different people.
By getting into university, I can increase my connections with people thus improving these soft skills.

My position in Diocesan Media allows me to know more people than others in school, as I have to constantly receive 'jobs' and allocate resources in order to submit products before the deadline.
For example, we have a video for CFC Old boys interview that needs to be shot. Ms Ng approached to me and I get to know her and Ms Keung on the day of shooting.
I am constantly creating a network with people, but it is not enough if the network is constrained by DBS.

---

My possible hurdle would be my passport and nationality.
Although I don't have a preference to study in US or UK, I do own an Australian passport, so I would most likely choose an Australian university as I can enjoy cheaper fees and also more perks.

I remember Ms Ng saying that they have a case where a student got full scholarship in US due to making a NGO in HK about environmental protection.
I always wanted to start a series in Diocesan Media where I could vlog myself as a DBS boy.
I got Paws United Charity as CAS so it would be a good excuse to stop procrastinating and start the series.
I hope that I could promote PUC to more students in DBS as there is only 4 spots for this year.

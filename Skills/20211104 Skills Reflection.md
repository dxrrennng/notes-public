After listening to Mr Khan's talk on the blue fridge programme and how the programme has changed him in different aspects of life, I've come up on a few ideas on how to help the society by contributing in these different projects.

I believe that the blue fridge project has a flaw on it. I believe that Mr Khan should make a guideline and what can be put inside the fridge and what cannot be. If the food placed inside the fridge is perishable, there is a risk that it would make the fridge smell bad.

We can all help the project by promoting and sharing the post made by the organization. Maybe that would trigger the domino effect and have the blue fridge programme shared all around the world

The quote I remembered the most was from Social Worker Ms Chu, "I believe that one of you guys would be influential in the society, maybe even become the Chief Executive of HK. You can help the needed ones by changing the policy." Although I don't see myself working anything related to policymaking twenty years later, I still believe that we can help by promoting equality in our field of work and interest.
